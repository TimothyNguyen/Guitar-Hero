Midi Messages - transmit real time info for the playback of a 
piece of music

Midi messages sent to one byte/8bits
Status Byte(1) - set to 1, Data Byte(7) set to 0

- There is note on:
"CCCC" is the MIDI channel (from 0 to 15)
"PPP PPPP" is the pitch value (from 0 to 127)
"VVV VVVV" is the velocity value (from 0 to 127)
Note Off:
Status byte : 1000 CCCC
Data byte 1 : 0PPP PPPP
Data byte 2 : 0VVV VVVV

Part 3: Notes and Chords
t=0 : 0x90 - 0x40 - 0x40 (Start of E3 note, pitch = 64)
t=0 : 0x90 - 0x43 - 0x40 (Start of G3 note, pitch= 67)
t=1 : 0x80 - 0x43 - 0x00 (End of G3 note, pitch=67)
t=1 : 0x90 - 0x45 - 0x40 (Start of A3 note, pitch=69)
t=2 : 0x80 - 0x45 - 0x00 (End of A3 note, pitch=69)
t=2 : 0x80 - 0x40 - 0x00 (End of E3 note, pitch=64)
t=2 : 0x90 - 0x3C - 0x40 (Start of C3 note, pitch = 60)
t=2 : 0x90 - 0x47 - 0x40 (Start of B3 note, pitch= 71)
t=3 : 0x80 - 0x47 - 0x00 (End of B3 note, pitch= 71)
t=3 : 0x90 - 0x48 - 0x40 (Start of C4 note, pitch= 72)
t=4 : 0x80 - 0x48 - 0x00 (End of C4 note, pitch= 72)
t=4 : 0x80 - 0x3C - 0x40 (End of C3 note, pitch = 60)

Part 4: Selecting Instruments
General Midi - List of 128 instruments that simplify compatibility

MIDI Tutorial Part 5 - Drum
- general midi: channel 10
0x99 0x23 0x40
0x99 - status byte
0x23 - note number used for acoustic bass drum
0x40 - mezzo forte nuance

Part 6: Using Midi Channels
16 different channels - with its own status

Part 7: Midi Controllers
128 Midi Controllers defined, only few are used in practice
The purpose is to set a value of a parameter in the synthesizer 
playing the notes

The most common controller numbers are the following:

0 = Sound bank selection (MSB)
1 = Modulation wheel, often assigned to a vibrato or tremolo effect.
7 = Volume level of the instrument
10 = Panoramic (0 = left; 64 = center; 127 = right)
11 = Expression (sometimes used also for volume control or similar, depending on the synthesizer)
32 = Sound bank selection (LSB)
64 = Sustain pedal (0 = no pedal; >= 64 => pedal ON)
121 = All controllers off (this message clears all the controller values for this channel, back to their default values)
123 = All notes off (this message stops all the notes that are currently playing)

Instrument Selection - LSB and MSB
synthesizer may contain one or more sound banks
You must first activate the new bank and then send the program 
change message

As the MSB and LSB can range from 0 to 127, there is a total of 
128 x 128 = 16384 possible sound bank to be selected. 

Part 8 - Pitch Bend
Status byte : 1110 CCCC
Data byte 1 : 0LLL LLLL
Data byte 2 : 0MMM MMMM
CCCC - Midi Channel
LLLLLLL - LSB of the pitch bend
MMMMMMM - MSB
